                    <p>&mdash; Hello! I’m an American novelist, journalist, and social activist.<strong style="margin-left: 0.0625em;"></strong> I believe in the need for systematic work and never wait for inspiration. By nature, I am not only a person, but also a melancholic. But I managed to overcome both in myself. I was greatly influenced by the discipline I learned when I was a sailor.</p>
